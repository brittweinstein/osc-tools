Allows enqueuing a batch of PDF files in the CNX legacy editor using a simple text input file. If no input file is specified, it will default to input.txt in the same directory as the script.

Every collection ID must be on its own line in the input file. IDs such as col12345 will be accepted, as well as 12345. Any IDs not matching either of those formats will not be enqueued.
